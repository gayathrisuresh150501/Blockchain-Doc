# ERC1155
- A novel token standard that aims to take the best from previous standards to create a fungibility-agnostic and gas-efficient token contract.
uses a single smart contract to represent multiple tokens at once.

Features:
- Effective Transfer: The ERC-1155 standard allows users to make massive transfers natively of the tokens within a smart contract. For example, in a smart contract with a series of fungible or non-fungible tokens, a developer can choose to transfer multiple tokens in the same operation. It not only reduces the transaction cost but also minimizes the impact on the network.
- Multiple Tokens in A Single Contract: Each ERC-1155 token describes the existence and operation of both the fungible and non-fungible token types. For example, while an ERC-1155 can create one or more NFTs, it can also describe fungible tokens – all within the same contract.
- Secure Transfer of Tokens: ERC-1155 token standard includes a function that checks whether a transaction is valid or not. If a transaction doesn’t go through, this function returns the token to the issuer. It helps when users accidentally make a mistake in the transcription or send out tokens to the wrong address. The code can automatically revert the transaction.
